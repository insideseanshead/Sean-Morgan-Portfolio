## Hello World
Coming from the illustration world I know the importance of a good portfolio site. In fact I have made a few in my time. Each time striving to teach myself something new. This time I set out to make a responsive site with bootstrap. [Deployed site](https://insideseanshead.github.io/Sean-Morgan-Portfolio/)

This will be the home to links for my deployed apps and sites. 

### Things to come.
The plan is to make this site a one stop shop for seeing my work and getting in touch with me. So now that the layout and responsiveness is there I can focus on coding the contact form to email me directly.

#### Things I've Learned so far.
I have used media queries to make responsive sites before with just html and css. Bootstrap is definetly a life saver, though I am glad to have the knowledge for troubleshooting. I gave myself the challenge of not only having the content be responsive but also to create a responsive background. In this case an illustration that shrinks with the viewport window.
